`WPSUCLI` downloads new salts from the WP API and replaces them with the ones in your wp-config.php file for every site on your server.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Installation

Open command line terminal (I prefer iTerm2) and run the following command.

```bash
sudo wget -qO wpsucli https://git.io/vykgu && sudo chmod +x ./wpsucli && sudo install ./wpsucli /usr/local/bin/wpsucli
```

This command will perform the following actions:

- Use sudo permissions
- Use wget to download `WPSUCLI` and rename it to `wpsucli` 
- Make the `wpsucli` executable
- Install `wpsucli` inside /usr/local/bin/ folder.

## üôå Usage

- Just run `wpsucli` and it will update the salts for every `wp-config.php` file on your server or PC.
- If you are running it on your server then run it from the root folder i.e. `cd /` and then run `wpsucli`

If for some reason the script doesn't work, you might want to check what is the output of this command 
`find . -name wp-config.php -print` this command should print the paths for all the wp-config.php files present inside your current directory or directories within it. If it doesn't display the paths, then you're probably at the wrong folder E.g. `cd ~` or `/root` ‚Äî¬†so just  `cd /` and then run `wpsucli`.
